==================

An ultra-clean 'Contact Us' form utilizing CSS3 transitions and some other cool stuff.

####Sample Image:

!['Clean UI Contact Us Form'](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/108401/799964/JHCHQdkL3TlbOii/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-14%20at%206.34.11%20PM.png "Clean UI Contact Us Form")

####Usage...

...is simple. Just plug and play. 

The ```form.less``` file is contains a sweeeet and easy to configure set of ```@variables``` right under the **CONFIG** header towards the top:

```@primary-color```: Used to set the color of the theme, which affects the underline focus, placeholder text color, and shadow glow effect.

```@icon-color```: Used to set the color of the icons.

```@pholder-color```: Used to set the color of the (unfocused) placeholder text;

```@font:``` In case you wanna change the font-family. Roboto by default.

```@form-width:```  Width of your form. Obviously this can be played with to fit your needs.

```@base```: This guy sets the base font size, and is used to determine padding of input fields and textareas.
	
------

I've also included a list of 'dope colors', or colors that I've used that work well here.
```@blue: #0ac;```

```@red: #f66;```

```@amber: #ffc107;```

```@blueGrey: #607d8b;```

```@lightGreen: #8bc34a;``` 

```@offBlack: #333;```

####Dependencies:

I am using [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) here, however you can obviously substitute these icons/input feilds with whatever you feel you need to.

####Have Fun WIth It

Obviously this is just a base to get you started. Add or remove input feilds as needed. Extend it. Maybe you would rather use a ```<button>``` tag instead of the ```input[type="submit"]``` that I've got going on. Maybe you have different icons. That's rad. I'd love to see anything you do with it.
